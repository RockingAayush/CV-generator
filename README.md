## Project Structure

- **views.py:** Contains the logic for handling form submission, template selection, and PDF generation.
- **models.py:** Defines the `Profile` model used to store user information.
- **templates/pdf:** Contains the HTML templates for the different CV designs.
- **urls.py:** Maps URLs to the appropriate views.

## PDF Generation

This project uses [pdfkit](https://pypi.org/project/pdfkit/) for rendering HTML templates as PDF files. Ensure that `wkhtmltopdf` is installed on your system.
Since wkhtmltopdf needs to be added to path, you'll need to install it manually. Hereâ€™s how you can do that:

- **Download the appropriate wheel file for wkhtmltopdf:**

    Visit a website like https://github.com/JazzCore/python-pdfkit for installation details, or download the .whl file from a trusted source.
- **Install the wheel file:**

    ```bash
    pip install /path/to/your/wkhtmltopdf.whl
    ```
- **Ensure wkhtmltopdf is available on your system's PATH:**

*Windows*
- Right-click on "This PC" or "My Computer" and select "Properties."
- Click on "Advanced system settings."
- Click on "Environment Variables."
- Under "System variables," find the PATH variable and click "Edit."
- Add the path to the directory where wkhtmltopdf.exe is located.

*Linux/macOS*
- You can add wkhtmltopdf to your PATH by editing your shell configuration file (~/.bashrc, ~/.zshrc, etc.):

```bash
export PATH="/path/to/wkhtmltopdf:$PATH"
```
  
- After adding it to the PATH, run source ~/.bashrc or source ~/.zshrc to apply the changes.
